# Simple Enough ECS

A Javascript game engine using an Entity-Component-System paradigm.

## License
GNU Public License, version 3.

## Design
* Modular, take-what-you-want architecture with `rollup` custom builds.
* Pluggable game loops, data structures, renderers, etc., but with an emphasis on WebGL.
* Using new JS data structures wherever possible, like `TypedArrays`.

## Status
Early days, pre-release.

## Build
* Designed as an `npm` package, uses conventions; e.g., `npm build`, `npm test`.
* Example code can be built with `npm run examples`.
